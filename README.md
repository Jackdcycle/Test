## Do you imagine any kind of solution?

**Core fields (non-negotiable)**

These should exist in every sustainability entity:

```jsx
id
organization_id
project_id
category_type
created_at
created_by
updated_at
updated_by
```

**Lifecycle & status (to enable transversal features)**

```jsx
status
source
is_deleted (soft delete)
```

**Traceability hooks (for Memory / SoR)**

```jsx
version
last_event_id
```
